# Oracle Fusion JDBC Driver

A read‑only JDBC driver that lets you run SQL queries against Oracle Fusion.
This minimal viable implementation works seamlessly in mature IDE's - DBeaver, DbVisualizer and IntelliJ. 
And it isn’t just for Java - it can be used from any JVM‑hosted language to build custom data pipelines.

## 🚀 Features
- **Your Credentials, Your Control:** Unlike many closed‑source solutions, this driver keeps your credentials under your control, ensuring peace of mind and security.
- **Minimalist Design:** A read‑only, no‑frills JDBC driver for Oracle Fusion exploring/reporting via WSDL.
- **IDE Integration:** Run SQL queries directly from your favorite IDE - DbVisualizer, IntelliJ, etc. without the extra overhead.

_**DBVisualizer**_

- **JVM-Hosted Flexibility:** Use this driver not only from Java but from any JVM‑hosted language for building custom data pipelines.
- **Easy to Configure:** Simple setup by providing your connection URL and credentials.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before using this driver, ensure you have the following:

- **Oracle Fusion Access:** Valid credentials with access to Oracle Fusion reporting (via WSDL).
- **JDK/JRE:** A Java 8 (or later) runtime installed on your machine.
- **Your IDE of Choice:** DBeaver, DbVisualizer, IntelliJ IDEA (or any other mature development environment I don't know and tested yet :)) .

## 📝 Installation

1. **Download the Driver:**

   Download the latest version of the driver from the releases of this repository (upper right corner of this page) linked below:

   [release driver](https://github.com/krokozyab/ofjdbc/releases/tag/initial)

2. **Or clone repository and build the driver yourself from the source code.**

3. **Create report in OTBI**

   In you fusion instance un-archive _DM_ARB.xdm.catalog_ and _RP_ARB.xdo.catalog_ from **otbireport** catalog of this repository
into _/Shared Foldrs/Custom/Financials_ folder (that can be different if you will, see logic in source code). 

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. **Place driver file into designated folder**
2. **In you IDE (Dbeaver, DBVisualizer, IntelliJ) register new driver pointing on driver file.**
3. **Chose my.jdbc.wsdl_driver.WsdlDriver for the class name.**
4. **In you IDE create new database connection using the driver from above**
5. **In connection string (JDBC URL) enter: jdbc:wsdl://you-server.oraclecloud.com/xmlpserver/services/ExternalReportWSSService?WSDL:/Custom/Financials/RP_ARB.xdo**
6. **Username and password for basic authentication.**

## 📝 TODO

This project is a minimal viable implementation, and there are several areas for future enhancement:

- **Additional JDBC Features:**
   - Support for advanced JDBC methods (scrollable ResultSets, etc.).

- **Error Handling:**
   - Improve the integration with IDE-specific features (e.g., better error messages).

- **Performance & Scalability:**
   - Optimize query pagination and fetch size management.
   - Now pagination is not fully implemented. Mean if you enter 'select * from xyz' the driver automatically converted it into 'select * from xyz FETCH FIRST 50 ROWS ONLY'
  but if you enter 'select * from xyz FETCH FIRST 100 ROWS ONLY' it leave it as it is. Pagination is you responsibility.

- **Extended Metadata:**
   - Implement additional DatabaseMetaData methods to provide richer metadata support.

- **Customizability:**
   - Explore supporting additional authentication mechanisms beyond Basic Auth.

Check back on the GitHub repository for updates and improvements as the project evolves.
